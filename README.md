# ece3220-project

This project is a stock trading program.  Users log into the program where they can access their portfolio.  Users can buy/sell
stocks along with the ability to set a min/max price to buy/sell stocks automatically.

The automatic buy/sell would be a great place to implement multithreading later.

Administrator accounts can also be created using inheritance.
